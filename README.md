# Litefy

A lighweight Spotify client for low-end smartphones (KaiOS included [not yet]) and computers.
The project is being designed with Angular 10, using the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference-beta/) and [Web Playback SDK](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-playback-sdk/quick-start/)
